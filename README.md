# Sudoku Solver
This an attempot at a "Sudoku Solver" console app, written in C++ and using a backtracking algorithm. Curently the project also supports reading puzzles from a text file or manually entering them.

## To Add
- ~~Menus to replace manual selection through commenting code~~
- clearer manual input (currently displays as string of 81 characrers)
- Auto detect from image (not sure how/if possiblem, but seems like a fun challenge)
