# Sudoku Solver
This an attempot at a "Sudoku Solver" console app, written in C++ and using a backtracking algorithm. The curently the project also supports reading puzzles from a text  file or manually entering them depending on what code is commented.

## To Add
- Menus to replace manual selection through commenting code
- clearer manual input (currently displays as string of 81 characrers)
- Auto detect from image (not sure how/if possiblem, but seems like a fun challenge)
